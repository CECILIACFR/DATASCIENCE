When I finally get the correct order, it is generally tasty. I'm a picky eater, and have found ways to navigate the menu to get items I like. Worked in the service industry for years as a server, bartender, and trainer. Taking and fulfilling orders is NOT hard, tedious at times though. I only go here when I see they are not busy, in hope that my order is correct when I go to leave. In the 10 times that I have been here in the past past year, I have only had 1 order that was perfectly correct. Just ONE, not an exaggeration. That one order was just 2 large fries and nothing else. Though I will mention that when I got home and pulled them out of the bag, they were hardly what you'd call filled, (nor did I enjoy any on the 3 minute drive home) so little so that I even sent a picture and post to McDonald's on Facebook, at least the few were hot. The evening staff is very pleasant, but the morning staff leaves a lot to be desired, as well as thinking that they can talk negatively about people in Spanish out in the open which, being a light skinned Puerto Rican, I understand perfectly.

Don't expect the place to be clean or the employees to be over the moon with courtesy. Like I said you get what you pay for. This is not a bad review it's just a Meh review because it's McDonalds. It's not like you're eating at a five-star Resort and getting a massage afterwards. However if McDonald's does decide one of these days to start serving alcohol I might have to pay it another visit. I don't go to McDonald's often. I only stopped in out of convenience. Like I said this is not a bad review to disrespect McDonald's in any way.,3 stars";;;

;;;
We try and avoid this place even when we specifically have a hankering for McDonald's. We always have an issue at this McDonald's no matter what time of day,  whether we order from a food delivery service or in person. The orders always get screwed up,  from missing items to getting a sausage egg and cheese mcgriddle that just had cheese! If there was other fast food options besides pizza and halal nearby we'd probably never go here again.;;;
But today I finally understood why it's a mess: there's no communication. It was a busy time since school had just let out and I stood for about 5 minutes waiting for a Dr. Pepper and watched the crew work in relative silence while pushing out food orders without tickets and without speaking to each other. Anyone who has worked in food service knows a quiet kitchen spells more trouble than a loud one. Eventually my sister flagged down the man doing drink orders and asked if the drink he'd just placed in the row of 8 other drinks he'd been setting down indiscriminately was our Dr. Pepper and he said yes...it was a Coke.;;;
"Management here really needs to have a talk to the crew about working together as a team and communication, especially when it's busy. Yes it's just a McDonald's, and I'm not expecting white glove service from a fast food joint, but our community deserves better than what we're getting for sure."",2 stars";;;

;;;
Never thought I'd be writing a review for a McDonald's, yet here we are. Was disappointed to hear that the purple packaging isn't available in the U.S. (@Corporate: missed opportunity!). Hesitant because the paper bag adorned with the BTS logo was not guaranteed to be available at all locations. Fears were quelled, as I saw other guests sitting outside, and the elusive BTS paper bag going for $70+ on eBay was elusive no longer. Utilized the self-service machines to order - quick and easy. Medium and large sizes available (opted for medium, which was more than enough food in hindsight). Liked the Cajun sauce more than the Sweet Chili sauce, but just a personal preference. Total of the medium BTS meal was $8.39 + 0.74 tax = $9.13. Food was nothing special; just happy to support the boys.;;

#2 the employees are not friendly, I wouldn't say they're mean, but they obviously don't care about any pleasantries, or seem to care about you.;;;
#3 there is no where in the store an area where you can grab napkins, or ketchup, or straws. You have to go up to the counter and ask them for packets and straws and utensils, during lunch time when lines are longer and it's getting congested at the counter, it makes it worse when people have to constantly come up to the counter and ask for something.;;;

Most of the seating is on the third floor, I didn't go up to it just because I had an ankle problem and unfortunately the elevator was out. The basement, and area you can't get to it, is where the girl is it so fancy contrapment takes your food from the grill to the second floor where you order. I just thought that was cool while I was waiting around for my food. They have about six self-serving machines that are in front of the restaurant.

A couple of years ago they modified the interior- they removed a lot of seats on the main floor in order to install electronic order kiosks.  There are now only a handful of places to sit in a ridiculously cramped manner.  Late at night they close the upstairs- leaving pretty much nowhere decent to sit and eat.

1st...this Mc Donald's seemed to have their own guidlines for COVID-19. And the guidlines they followed were NONE or ZERO. The place was VERY crowded.NO social distancing. NO one to monitor or count how many people were allowed in. it  did not feel or look clean or a safe environment ...good to  spread germs and viruses.;;;
alot of people from the street who were not customers just hanging around using many tables and  shoulder to shoulder in the seats. people passed out in the chairs with masks pulled off. They had ONE dining room person who just could not keep up with the mess that they were leaving. The bathroom was a horror show: obviously people were washing and cleaning more than just their hands inside. was dirty.;;;
2nd,..the saving grace of the restaurant was the cashier, the food expediter and the employees making the food. they were all very fast, pleasant, thanked me, and the food was hot, fresh and very good.;;;

I'm not sure if there is a homeless shelter nearby or if people just love to hang out in the place, but there are always less fortunate people there especially in the morning. Just this morning I've witnessed the NYPD escort a woman out of the restaurant that was loitering. There are signs throughout the restaurant that clearly state No Loitering and that there is a 30 min time limit. Now that the weather is getting colder, people are just looking to stay warm.;;;
;;;
"Unfortunately, McDonalds is in a difficult position. As a former General Manager of a fast food restaurant, I used to deal with """"rough"""" teenagers and """"undesirables"""" especially at night. I wanted my paying customers to have a friendly, warm and inviting environment to eat in with their families. The """"rough"""" crowd made that very difficult to maintain. I, like McDs started with signs. The McDs in this review also has full time security to help keep the people safe and moving.";;;
;;;
You see, you just can't stand at the door and not allow people to come into McDs. The best you can do is try to manage it. I give them a lot of credit for trying to do just that. I also give credit to the employees as they have to deal with it all day long. As far as the cleanliness, they can do a much better job there. I can't speak for all the people given Lobby Duty, but I've never seen one with a cleaning bottle and rag to clean the tables. So, even I had to sit at a table this morning that wasn't clean. It wasn't exactly disgusting, but it wasn't clean either.;;;
;;;
I've never been in the bathrooms because I try to avoid them at all costs. I've seen the people that come out of there and also the bathrooms at Penn Station down the block. It can't be pleasant in there and frankly, I wouldn't want to clean it either.;;;
;;;
There are other McDs in the area, but this one is at times convenient for me. You can't beat the price for breakfast in that area in NYC. I would NEVER bring my family there. But for a quick stop in the morning, it's ok.;;;
;;;
"So, the 3 stars are just for the environment, the """"ambiance"""" and the cleanliness. The food and the staff are great, it's just a """"difficult"""" place to eat in given the community."",3 stars";;;

Since I have frequented McDonald's for a long time, I must admit that I have mixed sentiments regarding the eatery. On the one side, the meal is typically pretty decent, and I like the quick and convenient service. However, there are some problems that I've come to realize over time that make me feel like the experience isn't as positive as it once was.;;;
;;;
The rising costs of the products on the menu are one of my main worries. Every time I visit McDonald's, it seems like the costs have increased once again. This makes it challenging to continue frequenting them as much as I once did, especially with the availability of more economical fast food alternatives.;;;
;;;
Another problem is that McDonald's used to give frequent and significant discounts and promotions, but lately they seem to be less frequent and generous. This is disappointing because I've always valued the ability to occasionally save a few dollars on my lunch.;;;
;;;
"Having said that, there are still a few aspects of McDonald's that I genuinely value. The majority of the cuisine is delicious and good, and the quickness of service is still unmatched. The restaurant is always spotless and well-kept, making it a perfect choice if you need a fast dinner on the run. Overall, I would say that McDonald's is still a good option for fast food, but because of the rising costs and less promotions, it has lost its place as my top pick. However, a typical McDonald's burger and fries are a great choice if you're searching for a quick and delectable dinner."",4 stars";;;

There is one manager here that frequently yells at his employees for no reason at all, IN FRONT OF THE CUSTOMERS! I honestly feel bad that they have to be treated like that because apparently the manager doesn't understand that places get busy and there will be a wait a bit longer than usual. This location always has homeless people standing/sitting at each exit of the parking lot. One hot, summer day, I was leaving this McDonald's and made the mistake of putting down my windows down before leaving the parking lot. I was stopped by one homeless man and he asked for money, and usually I don't carry cash, but I happened to have a couple quarters in my car, so I gave them to him and he thanked me for helping him and his brother out. I pulled forward a bit more, and his brother stood up, walked over to my car, and I thought he was just going to thank me for the money, but nope! He literally started climbing inside my car to get some food from the passenger seat. He was grabbing me, and had his hands on my steering wheel and I started driving away to get him to stop after offering him some more quarters so he could buy his own food, and he kept yelling at me saying that he wanted the food I had. In the end, I left being robbed of the few bucks I had in coins in my car, and feeling very much violated. Again, this could have been avoided by having my windows up, but I thought it would be worth including that experience in my review.

There was a """"deal"""" available through the McD's app that was a great value & fit what I enjoy at McD's (occaisionally). Everything processed for the order... once I succeeded in completing the order with small amount of difficulty. Checked my account two days later as part of semi-weekly review. The McD's mobile ordering double charged me for the order. They processed two charges for the one order. When rhe corporate McD's was contacted they apologized, stated the program has occasional quirks (being worked out), and told me I needed to drive out of my way to go back to the store to get my money back. After explaining that they would have to reimburse my time and expenses to do their legwork in correcting their error of stealing my money AND explaining that they simply review their detail processing report of electronic charges for the two transactions (I provided the actual transaction info for date, time, #'s etc) they agreed to process the charge reversal.... because they WOULD NOT reimburse my time/expenses to return to get my refund of money they stole out of my account. After considerable time and insistence on my part, the manager agreed and reviewed the transactions report, verified the double billing, and assured the charge will be reversed. I got a follow up call from the area manager for McD's who turned out to be VERY unprofessional and rude in her attitude and handling if the matter. She actually admitted she hung up on me when I was reprimanding her on her shortcomings for not listening to what I was saying and continually speaking loudly over me, while I was speaking. Interesting..... is this how McD's is improving the bottom line, by stealing? NO ONE at McD's, even after explaining the process to correct an improper charge, had a clue how to address or willingness to pursue. They directly stated it was on me. I had to come back to a store, out of my way, to get a refund of my money, that they improperly seized from my account. Unbelievable as that is for my 1st mobile order/purchase experience w/McD's they were excited I used it and recommended I try the mobile order system again soon. Yeah right..... I'm gonna use a system with a 100% failure rate (my experience) and that they have no knowledge of how to process system failures, that do occur to their admission & knowledge.

One thing about DC is there is alot of resources for folks who need money for bus fare or anything can find. Food too they know where to go. It's up to them to make that move.

"I stopped in for a quick bit, or so I thought. I had no issue with the food or the face that there was a wait. What I had an issue with was the one male working the counter was more interested in flirting with the girl with pink hair working the fry machine that he had customers waiting for him to stop talking to her just to get them items he left off their order. At one time I was able to finally get the pink haired girls attention and I told her I was missing a coke. She told him and he went on flirting. I finally got his attention and told him I still needed my coke and he turned around and asked someone else to get it and went right back to his flirting. I do not think that his actions or lack there of reflects the overall workers at this location, but at the end of the day his actions are reflected in the review ratings that myself and others have given.

Probably because they've all been shut down. I've been reluctantly stopping in this place while shopping in Macy's for many many years and it's the same experience everytime. At this point, I do it for the entertainment. The kiosk and ordering setup is a recipe for disaster, just for starters. But you will usually wait 30-45 minutes just to be told that all the food and everything you ordered is sold out. If you're lucky enough to get your food, and it seems edible, there's 0% chance the dining room will be open. With all that said, it's not even the worst part. The staff are the craziest, rudest, nastiest human beings you will ever experience. They have zero filter. They scream and curse at eachother and the customers. One time I got yelled at for asking for sweet and sour sauce and they then proceeded to gather and talk about me asking for sweet and sour sauce, as if there's something wrong with that. After ignoring the request I asked again and she made an over exaggerated movement while rolling her eyes and putting her hand out, telling me it was $1. For 1 sauce.

I was ignored by the first female and was given a puzzled look that they can't be opened. After I went around to seek attention from the other staff she rudely stated both bathrooms are not available, after I asked why she said """" they just are """". I asked to see what would cause them to be unusable but could only feel discriminated as she added no urgency to the issue. She then asked if I was management to even request to see the inside of the bathrooms. As a LONG TIME CUSTOMER. I suggest to keep your client based loyal to address this issue as it leaves a bad image on the franchise. I left feeling """"I didn't have it my way """". And that's just a bowl movement.

You know what to expect from the food which is both a plus and a minus. However at this particular McDonald's right on Garnet in Pacific Beach they are undergoing Construction. It seems like a complete redo the outside and some of the guest areas as well. It's a mess and noisy but does not look like any RI modeling of the kitchen area is being done. That makes me wonder why this has become the worst drive-through around even before the construction. Two cars in front of me still waited almost 10 minutes. Isn't that a lot from McDonald's? Or foremost drive-thrus these days it seems to be way too much time. Now I'm not just saying this because of today's visit this is been the case at this McDonald's now for the past couple of months. Maybe it's short-handed help but that would only be an excuse for once in awhile. Anyway not a great experience but probably should be eating elsewhere anyway.,2 stars";;;

When you have a breakfast special  you should want to please the customer. If the customer wants 2 sausage biscuits instead of 2 bacon biscuits  are a customer would prefer a a certain type of bread for there breafast sandwich special you should not put stipulations on what type of bread they want.  Other McDonald's have catered to my needs if your not willing to cater to customer needs then you will have less customers.  Also charging for ranch not everyone can eat ketchup because of acid and stomach problems and need ranch for there fries instead of ketchup. Anyone that says they need ranch for there fries are hashbrown not just chicken nuggets because they have stomach issues you should make exception to that for that.  And one last thing.  Your workers look miserable not one of them smiles at me im very outgoing person.  You need to explain to your workers that there attitudes are sour and need to cheer up. We all have bad days but when somone looks like they hate being there based off of there unfriendly customer service then they need more training.   Night service is better from my experience but the morning service needs to be looked at.

"This McDonald's here in Swanton VT is probably the worst place to get so called fast food! I go through the drive thru too order my food, but before I do go too McDonald's I always make sure that I have a full tank of gas in my car. Because by the time I get my food, I've already waisted at least 15 bucks in gas by the time I leave this place. I believe that if it's going too take a half hour or more to finally get my very Luke Warm Garbage then this McDonald's should not be allowed to call themselves a part of the Fast Food Chain!

I also witnessed him ask 1 of the workers about it. She was an older woman when I say she was very rude didn't care and walked off as he was asking her so at that point I just wanted a refund.

I wanted to try the pizza or pasta, but unfortunately I had eaten a nice dinner about an hour earlier and only had room for a hamburger, which I ordered through the app.  It was pretty hectic inside, with tons of kiosks for ordering, which was helpful since they had different language selections to match the language of those ordering.  Some of my family got hand scooped ice cream, but it was a nightmare, as nobody was working that section, and we had to wait ten minutes after waiting in the busy line at the counter to ask for somebody to help us.

We ordered from the self serve kiosk, for some reason the one we were at was not accepting payment, not sure if the others were broken too?

So, I went to the main counter, as I approached my number was being called from the main counter, so I guess the Ice Cream counter was not the pick up location?

I head back over to the Ice Cream Counter, and guess who reluctantly appears? The young Female Employee who was now told to come over to serve me... she DID NOT look impressed to be there! After fighting with the sliding glass doors that cover the Hard Ice Cream for several minutes, she finally got them open, I had to point out the Rocky Road Ice Cream, one small scoop was placed on the Waffle Cone, and I was sent on my way...

What;;;
I thought id have to check out the biggest play area at a McDonalds.. I actually have lived in Orlando for over 15 years and today was the first time I went.

Environment;;;
This is right off a busy intersection, i-Drive and sand lake. The parking can get packed.. The building is huge! You cannot miss it. It is 2 stories and the play area is quite big as well, with an arcade inside. There are 2 stories, you enter the play area on level 2. You order the food downstairs and you can sit upstairs. There are a lot of self ordering machines so it makes ordering go a little faster? Upstairs was VERY HOT! Like there was no AC... and when you walk downstairs it was cool.;;;

They have a fish tank here overcrowded with African cichlids, an aggressive type of fish who will chase each other around, nip at each other and other fish, and sometimes even kill them. They have one Bala shark, which is a very peaceful schooling fish who should be in a group of at LEAST 4 other Bala sharks. (Schooling fish can die from stress in some cases if they are alone.)  He is being nipped at, his fins are torn, and he gets about 16 inches long full grown. There are Plecos that also get about 24 inches long full grown in there too. I didnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t know who was in charge, I asked but apparently someone comes in to take care of them. I love the staff here! I just want to make sure their fish are being taken care of and happy. Itï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½anld be very happy in there. :) Keep in mind the rule of fish is every inch of fish (think about how big they will be full grown) should have at least one gallon, if not two gallons of water to swim around in. The cichlids alone get anywhere between 6-8 inches, and I couldnï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½t even count how many there is in there.

She FOLLOWED me to the other window, and started harassing me BETWEEN the barriers meant to stop the spread of Covid 19. Multiple times she stuck her face between the windows to berate me. She asked me what else I was waiting for after I got my drink. As I had just given her my money, she shouldn't be handling my food at all, much less trying to talk to me and knew I had a burger. She then closed the window, and started throwing a coniption that I couldn't hear. The then reopened the windows, stuck her face between the barriers and told me she knew what I had ordered. I told her I didn't understand, and she shoved her face further out and repeated she knew what my order was again, closer and more loudly. I don't get it, I've been here many times and gotten my food without any problems.

I placed a mobile order, and when I came to pick up it disappeared into the backroom chaos.  About 10 minutes go by and there were people overflowing the drivethrough and the indoor registers.  I figured I'd just hang out and just check in every once in a while, since I had nothing pressing to do.;;;
Dozens of orders went through while I was there.  Most of them went through slowly, and a LOT needed substitutions since many products weren't available.  The store's CO2 went down, so they couldn't give out soda.  Bottled drinks were being subbed for soda, shakes being subbed for ice cream, lemonades being subbed for tea.  They were trying with what they had, but what an absolute madhouse...  Listening to the regulars in line, it sounds like this has been common recently.;;;
;;;
This exercise of curiosity went on so long (~an hour) that there seemed to be a shift change.  Two of the new employees got together and figured out my mobile order.  Apparently, mobiles don't process automatically and need some kind of manual start by an employee - which didn't happen the previous times I asked.  Because of this, I'm sure that this doesn't reflect in their service metrics at all.;;;
;;;
The employee that was able to help me asked first for my order number.  The number she was looking for was supposed to be something like '756' or '1691', like you see on your paper receipts.;;;
However, that number is not actually sent to you via the app nor by email.  That sounds like an oversight with mobile ordering, rather than the local store.;;;

I patronize this McDonalds in Oak Park every morning. This morning I forgot my wallet. I asked the Supervisor if I could pay them the less than $5.00 breakfast tomorrow. They said so sorry No. I pleaded with this new manager that I'd never seen before. I asked for the manager that I'd spoken with on several occasions.;;;
She refused to see me, and he stated that her response would be the same!!! I asked him what was to happen to food on the counter in front of us. He said it would be discarded!!!!;;;
;;;
Seriously, I asked. So, I said that you'd rather throw it away then let me have it, a faithful customer.....So my lesson is now, Thank you for teaching me a valuable lesson. McDonalds doesn't care about my patronizing their establishment and I'm going to seriously break my coffee habit. No more McDonalds from Oak Park on Madison for me.;;;
